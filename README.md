## Prerequisite (Windows only)
We need to get shell scripts working on you system first.\\
Install [`Git Bash`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)(Comes along with Git) (Recommended).\
For help on installing Git Bash, check [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-git-git-bash-windows/) or [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMW7LiF_Oc4)\
_OR_\
Install [`MSys2`](https://msys2.org)(Not recommended, heavier on resources).\\\
NOTE: To launch the Git Bash terminal, search for "Git Bash" and Open it from there.
