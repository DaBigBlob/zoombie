## Installation and Use

If you are on Linux, Solaris or MacOS, then you do proceed to the next step. However, if you are on Windows, then you will need to install [`Git Bash`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Recommended). But you can also use any other Bash shell, like [`MSys2`](https://msys2.org) or [`WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (Not suggested, since heavy on resources).

For help on installing Git Bash, check [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-git-git-bash-windows/) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMW7LiF_Oc4)

> ### **â„¹ All the file names are Case-Sensitive**

1. Just download the `zoombie` and `zoom-meeting.txt` files into the same directory.
2. Fill in the `zoom-meeting.txt` file.
3. Run `sh zoombie`

[I might add an installation script later to make it easier]
